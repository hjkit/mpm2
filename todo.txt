We have been debugging getting mp/m 2 os to boot

Instructions to follow in:
mpm2_external/docs/eMPM_II_System_Implementors_Guide_Aug82.txt

Scripts we made in:
scripts/*.sh

I don't think we are creating the right files for MPMPLDR to read.
I found the sources for MPMLDR read th
~/src/mpm2/mpm2_external/mpm2src/MPMLDR/MPMLDR.PLM

Document what it does:
 - files used
 - order of operations
 - we know it reads MPM.SYS
 - does it just load it into memory and start it?
 - where does it load it? how does it know where?
 - does it relocate (use the .prl bits) or does MPM.SYS relocate itself
 - what memory banks are used none?
