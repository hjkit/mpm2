in ssh_session_libssh.cpp all the chars that fit in a buffer are removed:
con->output_queue().try_read()
then written to ssh_channel_write
Either ssh_channel_write will block which is bad
or drop characaters which is bad.
See if ssh_* has a method that says how many chars will fit
only get that many, leave the rest in the output buffer

 When a z80 is halted if it is interrupted out of the halt
 return goes on to the instruction after the halt.

 This is implemented in z80_runner.cpp at:
         if (cpu_->check_interrupts()) {
          cpu_->clear_halted();
        }
However this is basic cpu functionality and should be in ../cpmemu/src/qkz*

In z80_runner.cpp change the timer interrupt from 7 to 1 to leave 7
free for the user to run the CP/M 2.2 DDT. Likewise in bnkxios.asm
it hard codes patching 38H. Change that so the RST number is an equ 
and it does the math to get the location.
