I have been working on an ada compiler for z80
https://github.com/avwohl/uada80 which has thousands of ACATS
test library programs.  About 300 of them want an OS with tasking
and preemptive scheduling to test ada task code.  I was messing
around with mpm2 anyway, so I fleshed it out.  The scp / sftp
is handy for uada80 to get test info out.  For loading 300
test programs its probably simpler to load them into
a disk image.
